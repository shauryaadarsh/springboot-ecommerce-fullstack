# Spring Boot E-Commerce Fullstack Project

This is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.  
The project demonstrates real-world features such as authentication, product management, cart handling, and order processing.

The backend exposes secure REST APIs with JWT authentication, while the frontend provides a responsive user interface for browsing products, managing carts, and placing orders.

This project is built as part of my learning journey in full-stack development and showcases backend architecture, API design, and frontend integration.
